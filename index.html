Our winter retreat will be held on the weekend of Friday, January 27 through Sunday, January 29 at Cormaria Retreat House in Sag Harbor, N.Y.
</p>
<p>
We can accommodate 36 men and <strong>you must be vaccinated and boosted</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The retreat will start at 8PM on Friday and will end before noon on Sunday. The cost is $275 and a deposit of $100 is required. The balance of $175 will be collected on Friday evening. The deposit is non-refundable unless you cancel at least five days prior to the start of the retreat weekend. If you have a balance with us from the canceled Summer Retreat 2022, that balance will be applied to this retreat's fees. Please contact Steve if you do have a balance and will be attending. Those with a balance will have priority in reserving a place at the retreat.
</p>
<p>
All reservations are on a first come first served basis. Confirmation emails will be sent. If your deposit is not received in time your check will be returned to you.
</p>
<p>
A response to this email is not required if you are not attending this retreat unless, of course, you are inclined to donate to our scholarship fund which is used to help those who cannot afford the retreat fee.
</p>
<p>
You can register and pay your deposit and/or scholarship donation only by check or money order.
