at <a href="mailto:matttalbotgroup11@gmail.com">matttalbotgroup11@gmail.com</a> .</p><!-- We will be making some changes in the format of the retreat so as to get more involvement from the attendees.

The retreat will start at 8PM on Friday and will end before noon on Sunday. The cost is $300 and a deposit of $100 payable is required. The balance of $200 will be collected on Friday evening. The deposit is non-refundable unless you cancel at least five days prior to the start of the retreat weekend. You may pay by check or money order, and if you would like to pay via an electronic money transfer, please contact us (<a href="mailto:matttalbotgroup11@gmail.com">matttalbotgroup11@gmail.com</a>), and we will email you the details.

All reservations are on a first come first served basis. Confirmation emails will be sent. If your deposit is not received in time your check will be returned to you.
